## üèÅ Dependencies
1) [NVIDIA Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)
2) [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
3) [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
4) [Docker Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)

*Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and with CUDA 12.1 using RTX 4090 GPU.*

## üèãÔ∏è Pre trained weights for SportsMOT dataset
This trained network has only been trained on a single example dataset from the [SportsMOT dataset](https://github.com/MCG-NJU/SportsMOT). It was trained on the scoccer dataset specifically *v_gQNyhv8y0QY_c013*. [Sample Dataset on OneDrive from Authors](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtjeLq7YnYGRgQRrmqGr4B-k-xsC?e=7PndU8)

    <p>Overall System Design.</p>
</div>

The overall system is divided into individual sub-systems, Perception, ByteTracker, and Particle Filter. Each of the sub-systems are explained below.

### Perception Design
This again is divided into two components which is the one time quantization, then the setting up the ensembled network for Triton Inference Server.

#### Quantization Framework

</div>

The exact command used for quatization in TensoRT can be found [here](weights/quantize_yolo.sh), for this example FP16 was used.

#### Inference for Triton Inference Server using ensembled model

#### Full Pipeine
The entire source code for Perception is [here](tracker_system/perception) and the esembled model is located [here](models).

An example [here](tracker_system/perception/examples/perception_dataset.cpp) is a good starting point while making changes.


### ByteTrack Design
The [orginal authors paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06864) was used, the [Offical Reposiory](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack) gives a detailed explantion of the implementation.

### CUDA Particle Filter Design
This implementation uses a complete GPU accelerated Particle Filter with an additional Unscented Transform for the prediction step.

#### Structre of Array (SoA) for the states
We use a total of 10 states.

The SoA is defined [here](tracker_system/filter/include/filter/particle_states.cuh) and [here](tracker_system/filter/src/particle_states.cu).

## üèóÔ∏è Building the üê≥ Docker file
Start building the docker container.
```
bash build.sh
```

Compiling the code (One time process).
```
bash compile.sh
```
## ‚åõÔ∏è Running on sample data
To run the composed container with Triton and the executable.
```
DATASET_PATH=/path/to/your/dataset bash run_and_exit.sh
```

The output video gets saved in the ```/tracker_system/result``` folder.
